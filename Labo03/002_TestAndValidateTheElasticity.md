## Simulate heavy load to trigger a scaling action

* [Install the package "stress" on your Drupal instance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-stress-command-with-examples/)

* [Install the package htop on your Drupal instance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/htop-command-in-linux-with-examples/)

* Check how many vCPU are available (with htop command)

```
[INPUT]
htop

[OUTPUT]
//copy the part representing vCPus, RAM and swap usage
```

### Stress your instance

```
[INPUT]
//stress command
stress --cpu 4 --io 2 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 300s

[OUTPUT]
//copy the part representing vCPus, RAM and swap usage
//tip : use two ssh sessions....
```

* (Scale-IN) Observe the autoscaling effect on your infa

* (Scale-OUT) As soon as all 4 instances have started, end stress on the main machine.

[Change the default cooldown period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-scaling-cooldowns.html)

```
aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group \
--auto-scaling-group-name ASGRP_DEVOPSTEAM10 \

## Release Cloud resources

Once you have completed this lab release the cloud resources to avoid
unnecessary charges:

* Terminate the EC2 instances.
    * Make sure the attached EBS volumes are deleted as well.
* Delete the Auto Scaling group.
* Delete the Elastic Load Balancer.
* Delete the RDS instance.

(this last part does not need to be documented in your report.)

## Delivery
